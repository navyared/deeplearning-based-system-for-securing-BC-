This project is based on merging two technologies for securing the data ,This project focuses on addressing the security challenges in blockchain technology by leveraging deep learning techniques to detect malicious activities. Blockchain technology, while revolutionary and increasingly adopted in fields like finance, healthcare, and government, faces significant security threats due to its decentralized and distributed nature. These threats include double-spending, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and various other forms of malicious transactions.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The decentralized and immutable characteristics of blockchain systems, while advantageous, also expose them to unique security vulnerabilities. Traditional security measures often fall short in the blockchain context, necessitating advanced, intelligent solutions capable of identifying and mitigating these risks in real-time.
OBJECTIVE:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust, deep learning-based system that can effectively detect and classify security attacks on blockchain systems. By analyzing the network traffic generated by blockchain nodes, the proposed system aims to identify suspicious activities that could indicate potential security breaches.
APPROACH:
1.Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather network traffic data from blockchain nodes, ensuring it is representative of normal and malicious activities.
2.Feature Extraction: 
Analyze the collected data to extract relevant features that can help in distinguishing between benign and malicious transactions.
3.Model Development:
Develop a deep learning model tailored to the characteristics of blockchain network traffic. This model will be trained on the preprocessed data to learn patterns associated with different types of attacks.
4.Detection and Classification: 
Implement the trained model to monitor blockchain network traffic in real-time, identifying and classifying suspicious activities.
5.Evaluation:
Assess the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its effectiveness in detecting malicious transactions.
Discussion and Future Work: Analyze the results, discuss the limitations of the current approach, and propose directions for future research to enhance the system's capabilities.
